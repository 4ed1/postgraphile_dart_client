# Postgraphile x Dart

Dart Client Code that connects to a [Postgraphile server](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/).
Runs on Web, Server and Flutter. Provides abstractions for models and their relationships.
No code generators involved (for better and worse).

## Running Tests
Launch the small test env via `docker-compose up`, then run `pub run test`.
